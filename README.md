# Programming for money and fun

Old-school indie game developer & hacker. My languages are Russian & English.

Most of my career I develop games:

- For money: [Order of War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_War), [World of Tanks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_of_Tanks), Toy Defense ([1](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.melesta.toydefense), [2](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.melesta.toydefense2), [3](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.melesta.toydefense3)), [My Cafe](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.melesta.coffeeshop).
- For fun: [Сказка](https://the-tale.org/) ([github organization](https://github.com/the-tale)).

Interesting stuff about me:

- Have not attached to a single technology, can easily switch to the most appropriate stack for a current project.
- Can do a lot of things except programming: game design, marketing, support, community development, etc.
- Actually, I operate my own hobby mini-MMO game, where I do almost everything.
- Check my blog for interesting essays: https://tiendil.org/ — someday I will translate it to English :-)

Have a good day. Feel free to contact me by email: a.eletsky@gmail.com — I like to exchange letters.
