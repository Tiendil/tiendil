# Programming for money and for fun

Old-school indie game developer & hacker. My languages are Russian & English.

Most of my carrier I develop games:

- For money:[Order of War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_War), [World of Tanks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_of_Tanks), Toy Defense [1](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.melesta.toydefense), [2](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.melesta.toydefense2), [3](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.melesta.toydefense3), [My Cafe](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.melesta.coffeeshop).
- For fun: [Сказка](https://the-tale.org/) only Russian — [github](https://github.com/the-tale).

Interesting stuff about me:

- Have not attached to single techonogy, can easy switch to most appropriate stack for current project.
- Can do a lot of things except programming: marketing, support, community development, etc.
- Actually, I operate my own hobby mini-MMO game, where I do everithing.
- Check my blog for interesting essays: https://tiendil.org/ — someday I will translate it to English :-)

Have a good day. Fill free to contact me by any reason — I like to exchange letters.
