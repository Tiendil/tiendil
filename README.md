# Development for fun and profit

Old-school indie game developer & hacker. My languages are Russian & English.

Most of my career I have developed games:

- For profit: [Order of War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_War), [World of Tanks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_of_Tanks), Toy Defense ([1](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.melesta.toydefense), [2](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.melesta.toydefense2), [3](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.melesta.toydefense3)), [My Cafe](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.melesta.coffeeshop).
- For fun: [Сказка](https://the-tale.org/) ([github organization](https://github.com/the-tale)).

Besides games, I worked on some payment systems — a strange twist of fate :-D

Interesting stuff about me:

- Have not attached to a single technology, can easily switch to the most appropriate stack for a current project.
- Can do a lot of things besides programming: game design, marketing, support, community development, etc.
- For 13 years, I operated my own hobby mini-MMO game, where I did almost everything.
- Check my blog for long essays on game/soft development, thinking, and books: [tiendil.org](https://tiendil.org/)

Have a good day. Feel free to contact me by email at a.eletsky@gmail.com — I enjoy exchanging letters.
